				<p>Since our standards for service dogs and explosive detection canines are so high, some dogs do not complete the program for either behavioral or health reasons .  These dogs will be released as pets for a charge of $4,000.00.   They will come to you spayed or neutered, current on all their vaccines, and incredibly bonded to humans.  The feedback weâ€™ve gotten from everyone who has ever adopted one of our dogs is that they never knew that dogs could be as focused on people as are ours.

				If you are interested in adopting one of our released dogs, please print </p>
